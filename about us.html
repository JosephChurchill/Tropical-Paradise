                        src="images/Sandcastle History.jpg"

                        <a>I</a>t all started in 1904 when two young Australian
                        boys (John and Jack) built a sandcastle. Following
                        their debut success, the pair went on to found John
                        and Jack’s Hostel in Kentucky, USA. After twenty years
                        in the business they broadened their venture, buying
                        up most of the large infrastructure in the state. It
                        was at this point that the idea of Tropical Paradise
                        was born.</p>
                    <p class="about-us-paragraph">John and Jack, one of the
                        wealthiest duos in the history of the planet, wanted a
                        place to wind down after a long week. They both had
                        their weird eccentricities (Jack was weirder), so what
                        better spot could they settle on than a hut in the
                        middle of the Sahara Desert! The year 1976 saw the
                        creation of the first ever Tropical Paradise resort,
                        what we now as Saharan Bungalow. This was a resort
                        where eccentric billionaires could pay an exorbitant
                        price for a weekend away from the toils and tears of
                        working life.</p>
                    <p class="about-us-paragraph">Other resorts followed in the
                        next years, with a Tibetan Cave opening for business in
                        1981 and the company buying up part of Antarctica so
                        you could pitch a tent there in ’85. These days there
                        are a range of 7 different resort locations to choose
                        from for your next vacation.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="about-us-paragraph">We always make sure to donate
                        to charities, with $17,000 USD reported as donations in
                        the five-year period since July 2009. We are the
                        primary donor for the Sassy Cats Research Foundation,
                        an institute dedicated to the research and protection
                        of sassy felines. We have also donated to larger
                        charities in the past, including the Heart Liver
                        Disease Foundation and the Institute for Protection of
                        Addresses.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="about-us-paragraph">We’ve partnered with a tonne
